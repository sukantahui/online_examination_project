# Animated Carousel
This project showcases a dynamic and visually appealing animated carousel implemented using HTML and CSS. The carousel features a rotating display of cards with unique content, creating an engaging user experience. Below is an overview of the HTML and CSS code that powers this animated carousel.

## Introduction
The Animated Carousels project is designed to provide an interactive way to present information using rotating cards within a circular layout. The carousel consists of multiple cards, each containing a title and description. The cards rotate around the center of the carousel in an animated fashion, creating an eye-catching effect.

## HTML Structure
The HTML code defines the structure of the carousel and its content. It includes the necessary metadata, stylesheet link, and the carousel container. The carousel content is structured as an unordered list (`<ul>`) containing individual list items (`<li>`) with card content.

## CSS Styles
The CSS code is responsible for styling and animating the carousel. It utilizes CSS variables for customization and keyframe animations for the rotation and other effects. The stylesheet defines the appearance of cards, circles, and animations. It also includes media queries for responsiveness.

## Key Features
* Rotating cards with dynamic content.
* Smooth and visually pleasing animations.
* Adjustable rotation speed and count.
* Responsive design for various screen sizes.\
  
## Usage
To use this animated carousel in your project:

1. Copy the HTML code into your HTML file.
2. Copy the CSS code into your CSS file or `<style>` tags.
3. Customize the content and styling as needed.
4. Add more cards by duplicating the list items within the `<ul>`.
   
## Customization
You can customize various aspects of the carousel by modifying the CSS variables defined in the `:root` section of the CSS code. Adjust variables like `--rotate-speed`, `--count`, and easing functions for different effects.
